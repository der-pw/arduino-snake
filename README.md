- Feature-rich snake game for Arduino written in C++
- based on the great work of https://github.com/ondt/arduino-snake

- I have implemented a sound feature. 
- Now the game has a start sound, a game over sound and every bite is accompanied acoustically.
- Because the PWM signal of the 8x8 matrix display can disturb the buzzer, it is recommended to use a 100uF capacitor directly between 5+ and GND.
